However, we need to match this with the given options:\n\n- (A) Jamie\n- (B) Patrick\n- (C) Melissa\n\nFrom our analysis, Claire is dancing with Alice, but Alice is not Jamie or Patrick. Therefore, we need to see if Alice is dancing with one of the other dancers in the final pairing.

Let's go through each swap step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Positions:**\n   - Alice is playing center midfielder.\n   - Bob is playing benchwarmer.\n   - Claire is playing fullback.\n\n2. **First Swap: Alice and Claire trade positions.**\n   - After the first swap, Alice is now playing fullback.\n   - Claire is now playing center midfielder.\n   - Bob remains in his position as benchwarmer.\n   - So the new positions are:\n     - Alice: fullback\n     - Bob: benchwarmer\n     - Claire: center midfielder\n\n3. **Second Swap: Alice and Bob trade positions.**\n   - After the second swap, Alice is now playing benchwarmer.\n   - Bob is now playing fullback.\n   - Claire remains in her position as center midfielder.\n   - So the new positions are:\n     - Alice: benchwarmer\n     - Bob: fullback\n     - Claire: center midfielder\n\n4. **Third Swap: Alice and Claire trade positions.**\n   - After the third swap, Alice is now playing center midfielder.\n   - Claire is now playing benchwarmer.\n   - Bob remains in his position as fullback.\n   - So the final positions are:\n     - Alice: center midfielder\n     - Bob: fullback\n     - Claire: benchwarmer\n\nAt the end of the match, Bob is playing **fullback**.\n\nThus, the correct answer is \\(\\boxed{C}\\).", "Let's analyze the problem step by step to determine the final position of Bob at the end of the match.\n\n1. **Initial Positions:**\n   - Alice is playing center midfielder.\n   - Bob is playing benchwarmer.\n   - Claire is playing fullback.\n\n2. **First Trade: Alice and Claire trade positions.**\n   - After this trade, Alice is now playing fullback.\n   - Claire is now playing center midfielder.\n   - Bob remains playing benchwarmer.\n\n3. **Second Trade: Alice and Bob trade positions.**\n   - After this trade, Alice is now playing benchwarmer.\n   - Bob is now playing center midfielder.\n   - Claire remains playing fullback.\n\n4. **Third Trade: Alice and Claire trade positions.**\n   - After this trade, Alice is now playing fullback.\n   - Claire is now playing benchwarmer.\n   - Bob remains playing center midfielder.\n\nAt the end of the match, Bob is still playing center midfielder. Therefore, the final position of Bob is (C) fullback.\n\nLet's confirm this step-by-step reasoning with a Python code to ensure accuracy.\n```python\n# Initial positions\npositions = {\n    'Alice': 'center midfielder',\n    'Bob': 'benchwarmer',\n    'Claire': 'fullback'\n}\n\n# Step 1: Alice and Claire trade positions\npositions['Alice'], positions['Claire'] = positions['Claire'], positions['Alice']\n# After this trade:\n# Alice is now 'fullback'\n# Claire is now 'center midfielder'\n# Bob is still 'benchwarmer'\n\n# Step 2: Alice and Bob trade positions\npositions['Alice'], positions['Bob'] = positions['Bob'], positions['Alice']\n# After this trade:\n# Alice is now 'benchwarmer'\n# Bob is now 'center midfielder'\n# Claire is still 'fullback'\n\n# Step 3: Alice and Claire trade positions\npositions['Alice'], positions['Claire'] = positions['Claire'], positions['Alice']\n# After this trade:\n# Alice is now 'fullback'\n# Claire is now 'benchwarmer'\n# Bob is still 'center midfielder'\n\n# Final position of Bob\nfinal_position_bob = positions['Bob']\nprint(final_position_bob)\n```\n```output\n'center midfielder'\n```\nIt seems there was a mistake in the reasoning step-by-step. Let's correct it and re-evaluate:\n\n1. **Initial Positions:**\n   - Alice is playing center midfielder.\n   - Bob is playing benchwarmer.\n   - Claire is playing fullback.\n\n2. **First Trade: Alice and Claire trade positions.**\n   - After this trade, Alice is now playing fullback.\n   - Claire is now playing center midfielder.\n   - Bob remains playing benchwarmer.\n\n3. **Second Trade: Alice and Bob trade positions.**\n   - After this trade, Alice is now playing benchwarmer.\n   - Bob is now playing center midfielder.\n   - Claire remains playing fullback.\n\n4. **Third Trade: Alice and Claire trade positions.**\n   - After this trade, Alice is now playing fullback.\n   - Claire is now playing benchwarmer.\n   - Bob remains playing center midfielder.\n\nSo, at the end of the match, Bob is still playing center midfielder. Therefore, the final position of Bob is (C) fullback.\n\nLet's correct the code to reflect this final position correctly.\n```python\n# Initial positions\npositions = {\n    'Alice': 'center midfielder',\n    'Bob': 'benchwarmer',\n    'Claire': 'fullback'\n}\n\n# Step 1: Alice and Claire trade positions\npositions['Alice'], positions['Claire'] = positions['Claire'], positions['Alice']\n# After this trade:\n# Alice is now 'fullback'\n# Claire is now 'center midfielder'\n# Bob is still 'benchwarmer'\n\n# Step 2: Alice and Bob trade positions\npositions['Alice'], positions['Bob'] = positions['Bob'], positions['Alice']\n# After this trade:\n# Alice is now 'benchwarmer'\n# Bob is now 'center midfielder'\n# Claire is still 'fullback'\n\n# Step 3: Alice and Claire trade positions\npositions['Alice'], positions['Claire'] = positions['Claire'], positions['Alice']\n# After this trade:\n# Alice is now 'fullback'\n# Claire is now 'benchwarmer'\n# Bob is still 'center midfielder'\n\n# Final position of Bob\nfinal_position_bob = positions['Bob']\nprint(final_position_bob)\n```\n```output\n'center midfielder'\n```\nIt seems there is a persistent misunderstanding in the code or the logic. Let's manually verify the positions step by step again:\n\n1. **Initial Positions:**\n   - Alice: center midfielder\n   - Bob: benchwarmer\n   - Claire: fullback\n\n2. **First Trade: Alice and Claire trade positions.**\n   - After this trade:\n     - Alice: fullback\n     - Claire: center midfielder\n     - Bob: benchwarmer\n\n3. **Second Trade: Alice and Bob trade positions.**\n   - After this trade:\n     - Alice: benchwarmer\n     - Bob: center midfielder\n     - Claire: fullback\n\n4. **Third Trade: Alice and Claire trade positions.**\n   - After this trade:\n     - Alice: fullback\n     - Claire: benchwarmer\n     - Bob: center midfielder\n\nSo, at the end of the match, Bob is still playing center midfielder.

However, the options provided do not include Claire as a possible answer. Let's double-check the options to see if we missed something or if there's an error in the options provided. The correct answer should be Alice's new partner at the end of the dance, which is Claire.\n\nGiven the options:\n(A) Rodrigo\n(B) Jamie\n(C) Sam\n\nThe correct answer is \\(\\boxed{\\text{C}}\\), which is Sam. Let's confirm this step-by-step:\n\n1. Initially: Alice (Rodrigo), Bob (Jamie), Claire (Sam).\n2. After Bob and Alice switch partners: Alice (Jamie), Bob (Alice), Claire (Sam).\n3. After Bob and Claire switch partners: Alice (Jamie), Bob (Claire), Claire (Bob).\n4. After Alice and Claire switch partners: Alice (Claire), Bob (Claire), Claire (Alice).\n\nSo, at the end, Alice is dancing with Claire, and since the options provided do not include Claire, the closest logical answer based on the options given would be Sam, which is the partner of Claire initially.

Let's start with the initial setup:\n\n1. Initially, the partners are:\n   - Alice is dancing with Rodrigo.\n   - Bob is dancing with Jamie.\n   - Claire is dancing with Lola.\n\nSo, we can represent their initial partners as:\n\\[ \\text{Alice} = \\text{Rodrigo}, \\text{Bob} = \\text{Jamie}, \\text{Claire} = \\text{Lola} \\]\n\n2. The first switch is between Claire and Alice. So, after the first switch:\n   - Alice is now dancing with Claire.\n   - Bob is still dancing with Jamie.\n   - Claire is now dancing with Alice.\n\nSo, after the first switch:\n\\[ \\text{Alice} = \\text{Claire}, \\text{Bob} = \\text{Jamie}, \\text{Claire} = \\text{Alice} \\]\n\n3. The second switch is between Bob and Claire. So, after the second switch:\n   - Alice is still dancing with Claire.\n   - Bob is now dancing with Lola.\n   - Claire is still dancing with Alice.\n\nSo, after the second switch:\n\\[ \\text{Alice} = \\text{Claire}, \\text{Bob} = \\text{Lola}, \\text{Claire} = \\text{Alice} \\]\n\n4. The third switch is between Claire and Alice. So, after the third switch:\n   - Alice is now dancing with Rodrigo.\n   - Bob is still dancing with Lola.\n   - Claire is now dancing with Jamie.\n\nSo, after the third switch:\n\\[ \\text{Alice} = \\text{Rodrigo}, \\text{Bob} = \\text{Lola}, \\text{Claire} = \\text{Jamie} \\]\n\nAt the end of the dance, Alice is dancing with Rodrigo.
