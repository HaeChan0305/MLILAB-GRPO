The penguin table lists the following penguins:\n\n- Louis, 7, 50, 11\n- Bernard, 5, 80, 13\n- Vincent, 9, 60, 11\n- Gwen, 8, 70, 15\n- James, 12, 90, 12\n\nFrom this, we can see that the penguin in the giraffe table is not listed in the penguin table. Therefore, the name of the last penguin is James.\n\nThe correct answer is \\boxed{E}.", "To determine the name of the last penguin, we need to compare the heights and weights of the penguins listed in the table. The question does not provide specific criteria for identifying the last penguin, so we will assume that the height and weight are the primary factors to consider.\n\nLet's list the penguins along with their heights and weights:\n\n- Louis: 50 cm, 11 kg\n- Bernard: 80 cm, 13 kg\n- Vincent: 60 cm, 11 kg\n- Gwen: 70 cm, 15 kg\n- James: 90 cm, 12 kg\n\nNow, let's compare the heights and weights to find the penguin that is the \"last\" in terms of these attributes. We can start by looking at the highest and lowest values:\n\n1. **Height Comparison:**\n   - James: 90 cm\n   - Bernard: 80 cm\n   - Vincent: 60 cm\n   - Gwen: 70 cm\n   - Louis: 50 cm\n\n   The highest height is 90 cm, which belongs to James.\n\n2. **Weight Comparison:**\n   - Gwen: 15 kg\n   - Bernard: 13 kg\n   - Vincent: 11 kg\n   - Louis: 11 kg\n   - James: 12 kg\n\n   The highest weight is 15 kg, which also belongs to Gwen.\n\nSince both James and Gwen have the highest height and weight, we need to consider the order in which they appear in the table. James is listed after Gwen, so James is the last penguin in terms of height and weight.\n\nTherefore, the name of the last penguin is \\boxed{E}.", "To determine the name of the last penguin, we need to analyze the given tables and identify the pattern or rule that governs the addition of new entries. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Penguin Table:**\n   - Name: Louis, Age: 7, Height: 50 cm, Weight: 11 kg\n   - Name: Bernard, Age: 5, Height: 80 cm, Weight: 13 kg\n   - Name: Vincent, Age: 9, Height: 60 cm, Weight: 11 kg\n   - Name: Gwen, Age: 8, Height: 70 cm, Weight: 15 kg\n\n2. **New Penguin Added:**\n   - Name: James, Age: 12, Height: 90 cm, Weight: 12 kg\n\n3. **Giraffe Table:**\n   - Name: Jody, Age: 5, Height: 430 cm, Weight: 620 kg\n   - Name: Gladys, Age: 10, Height: 420 cm, Weight: 590 kg\n   - Name: Marian, Age: 2, Height: 310 cm, Weight: 410 kg\n   - Name: Donna, Age: 9, Height: 440 cm, Weight: 650 kg\n\nFrom the penguin table, we can see that the names are \"Louis, Bernard, Vincent, Gwen, James\".

The species in the penguin table are: Louis, Bernard, Vincent, Gwen. The species in the giraffe table are: Jody, Gladys, Marian, Donna. \n\nCombining these, we have the following unique species: Louis, Bernard, Vincent, Gwen, Jody, Gladys, Marian, Donna. \n\nCounting these, we find there are 8 unique species listed in the tables.
