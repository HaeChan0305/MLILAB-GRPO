However, the question asks if you return to the starting point **overall**, considering all movements (including changes in direction).\n\nTo determine if you return to the starting point overall, we need to consider the net movement in all directions (x, y, etc.). Since the problem only specifies movements along the x-axis, and no movements are specified in the y or other directions, we can conclude that you return to the starting point along the x-axis.\n\nHowever, the question is phrased in a way that suggests a more comprehensive answer. Given the information provided, the most accurate answer is:\n\n\\boxed{Yes}", "Let's break down the instructions step by step to determine if you return to the starting point:\n\n1. **Start facing forward.**\n2. **Take 10 steps left.**\n   - This moves you 10 steps in the left direction.\n3. **Take 7 steps right.**\n   - After moving left, taking 7 steps right brings you 7 steps in the right direction.\n4. **Take 4 steps right.**\n   - After the initial 7 steps right, taking 4 more steps right brings you 11 steps right in total.\n5. **Take 1 step left.**\n   - After moving 11 steps right, taking 1 step left brings you 10 steps right.\n\nNow, let's calculate the net movement:\n\n- **Left steps:** 10 steps left\n- **Right steps:** 11 steps right\n\nThe net movement is 11 steps right minus 10 steps left, which equals 1 step right.\n\nSince you are only 1 step right from the starting point, you do not return to the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{No}.", "To determine if you return to the starting point after following the given instructions, let's break down each step:\n\n1. **Take 10 steps left**: This moves you 10 steps in the negative x-direction (left).\n2. **Take 7 steps right**: This moves you 7 steps in the positive x-direction (right). The net movement in the x-direction is \\(10 - 7 = 3\\) steps left.\n3. **Take 4 steps right**: This moves you 4 steps in the positive x-direction (right). The net movement in the x-direction is now \\(3 + 4 = 7\\) steps left.\n4. **Take 1 step left**: This moves you 1 step in the negative x-direction (left). The net movement in the x-direction is now \\(7 - 1 = 6\\) steps left.\n\nSince the net movement in the x-direction is 6 steps left, you do not return to the starting point.

To return to the starting point, the net movement should be zero (i.e., equal steps left and right).\n\nSince 9 steps left ≠ 11 steps right, you do not return to the starting point.\n\n**Final Answer:** \\boxed{No}"]], "filtered_resps": ["Yes"], "filter": "boxed-extract", "metrics": ["pass_at_k", "accuracy_at_k"], "doc_hash": "b97f80915a0c2374e0b29890c47b5647eb851bbc2f1a7772ce557c2173a6d59f", "prompt_hash": "e66bdeab65143fac966855b80560d8acd9d9a3a89510633807db0c890959c2a9", "target_hash": "85a39ab345d672ff8ca9b9c6876f3adcacf45ee7c1e2dbd2408fd338bd55e07e", "pass_at_k": 1, "accuracy_at_k": 1.0}

Now, you have moved a total of 10 units forward.\n3. **Turn right**: Turning right means you are now facing a new direction (e.g., if you were facing forward, you turn to the right, so you are now facing to the right).\n4. **Turn right again**: After the first right turn, turn right again.

However, the net horizontal movement is 14 steps to the right, which means you are not back at the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: **No**.", "To determine if you return to the starting point, let's break down each movement step by step:\n\n1. **Take 6 steps backward**: This means you move 6 steps in the opposite direction of your initial movement. If you were facing forward, you would now be facing backward.\n2. **Take 8 steps left**: Now, you are facing backward, so moving left means you are turning to the left. This could be considered a change in direction.\n3. **Take 3 steps right**: Moving right from a backward position means you are turning to the right.\n4. **Take 7 steps forward**: Moving forward from a right position means you are moving in the same direction you were initially facing (forward).\n5. **Take 3 steps right**: Continuing to move right from a forward position means you are still moving forward.\n6. **Take 9 steps right**: Moving 9 steps right from a forward position means you are moving further forward.\n7. **Take 1 step backward**: Moving backward from a right position means you are turning to the left.\n8. **Take 7 steps left**: Moving left from a backward position means you are turning to the right.\n\nNow, let's summarize the net effect of each movement:\n\n- **Initial Position**: Facing forward.\n- **After 6 steps backward**: Facing backward.\n- **After 8 steps left**: Facing left.\n- **After 3 steps right**: Facing right.\n- **After 7 steps forward**: Moving forward.\n- **After 3 steps right**: Moving right.\n- **After 9 steps right**: Moving further right.\n- **After 1 step backward**: Turning left.\n- **After 7 steps left**: Turning right.\n\nTo determine if you return to the starting point, we need to check the net displacement in both the horizontal (left/right) and vertical (forward/backward) directions.\n\n- **Horizontal Displacement**:\n  - 6 steps backward (left) + 3 steps right + 9 steps right - 1 step backward = 6 - 3 + 9 - 1 = 11 steps right.\n  \n- **Vertical Displacement**:\n  - 8 steps left + 7 steps forward = -8 + 7 = -1 step (1 step backward).\n\nSince there is a net horizontal displacement of 11 steps to the right and a net vertical displacement of 1 step backward, you do not return to the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{No}."]], "filtered_resps": ["No"], "filter": "boxed-extract", "metrics": ["pass_at_k", "accuracy_at_k"], "doc_hash": "71d4ca25ae197893601c71db36e8f379309fd7ba16a602016825cf83b88d414d", "prompt_hash": "f7766c2f2c5e7d9a09ebf6798534583c70b84cae416064f1e2e2201b860d19e4", "target_hash": "85a39ab345d672ff8ca9b9c6876f3adcacf45ee7c1e2dbd2408fd338bd55e07e", "pass_at_k": 0, "accuracy_at_k": 0.0}
