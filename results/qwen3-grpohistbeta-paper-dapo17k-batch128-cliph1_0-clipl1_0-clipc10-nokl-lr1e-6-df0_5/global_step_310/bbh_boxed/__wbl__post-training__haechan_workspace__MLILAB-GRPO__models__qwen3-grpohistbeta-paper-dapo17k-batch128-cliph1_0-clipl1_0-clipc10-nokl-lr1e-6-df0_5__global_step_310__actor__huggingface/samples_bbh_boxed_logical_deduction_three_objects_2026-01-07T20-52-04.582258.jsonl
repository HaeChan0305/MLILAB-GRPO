This means the truck is older than the minivan.\n   - From the second statement, we know that the station wagon is newer than the minivan. This means the station wagon is older than the minivan.\n\n3. **Combining the Information:**\n   - We now have two pieces of information:\n     - The minivan is newer than the truck.\n     - The station wagon is newer than the minivan.\n   - Combining these, we get:\n     - The station wagon is newer than the minivan, and the minivan is newer than the truck.\n   - Therefore, the order from newest to oldest is: station wagon > minivan > truck.\n\n4. **Determining the Newest and Second-Newest:**\n   - The station wagon is the newest.\n   - The minivan is the second-newest.\n\n5. **Matching with the Options:**\n   - (A) The station wagon is the second-newest: This is incorrect because the station wagon is the newest.\n   - (B) The minivan is the second-newest: This is correct based on our analysis.\n   - (C) The truck is the second-newest: This is incorrect because the truck is the oldest.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \\(\\boxed{B}\\).", "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the vehicles and their relationships:**\n   - There are three vehicles: a station wagon, a minivan, and a truck.\n   - The minivan is newer than the truck.\n   - The station wagon is newer than the minivan.\n\n2. **Translate the relationships into a sequence:**\n   - From the first piece of information, \"The minivan is newer than the truck,\" we can write: Minivan > Truck.\n   - From the second piece of information, \"The station wagon is newer than the minivan,\" we can write: Station Wagon > Minivan.\n\n3. **Combine the relationships to form a complete sequence:**\n   - We have two pieces of information: Minivan > Truck and Station Wagon > Minivan.\n   - Combining these, we get: Station Wagon > Minivan > Truck.\n\n4. **Determine the relative ages of the vehicles:**\n   - The sequence Station Wagon > Minivan > Truck tells us the order of the vehicles from newest to oldest.\n   - Therefore, the station wagon is the newest, the minivan is in the middle, and the truck is the oldest.\n\n5. **Identify which vehicle is the second-newest:**\n   - From the sequence, the minivan is the second-newest.\n\nThus, the correct answer is \\boxed{B}.", "To solve this problem, let's analyze the information given step by step:\n\n1.

The yellow book is to the right of the blue book.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Understanding the Positions:**\n   - The orange book is to the left of the blue book.\n   - The yellow book is to the right of the blue book.\n\n   This means that the orange book cannot be on the right of the blue book, and the yellow book cannot be on the left of the blue book. Therefore, the books must be arranged in a specific order relative to each other.\n\n2. **Possible Arrangements:**\n   - Since the orange book is to the left of the blue book and the yellow book is to the right of the blue book, one possible arrangement is:\n     - Orange book (left) → Blue book → Yellow book (right).\n   - Another possible arrangement could be:\n     - Orange book (left) → Yellow book → Blue book (right).\n\n3. **Determining the Correct Order:**\n   - The problem states that the books are arranged in a fixed order, and the statements are logically consistent within each paragraph.
